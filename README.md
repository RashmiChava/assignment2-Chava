###### Hyderabad

My favourite place is Hyderabad. The state is famous for its beauty as well as affluence. The Mughals conquered Hyderabad. Hyderabad is famous and is known for its food that is **Hyderabadi Biriyani**. And most people love food. In Hyderabad, the majority is Muslim, and that is the reason why Hyderabadi Biriyani is famous. The town is known for its monuments, including the fort of **Golconda** and the marvellous **Charminar**.Before some years, the state was called Baghnagar,and later on, it was changed into the name Hyderabad.
